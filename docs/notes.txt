Game notes:

- list 5 random categories from the dictionary
- player picks category
- pick random question from that category and ask player
- if the player is correct: reward $$$ points (eventally)
		for now, print "correct" and move on
- if the player is wrong: -200 points (eventually)
		for now, print "Wrong" and move on
- ask categories again

classes: 
	dictionary (module)
	player
	game
	category
	question / answer

	question/answer list
	category list


so for getting the categories --
	we're going to need a list of both categories, and questions
	and remember to pop the question once it's answered

TODOS:
	X check for length of category and handle removing empty categories
	X make sure our category choices are UNIQUE!
	- let's make an ENGINE class/module to handle running games?
	- Build PARSER for handling skip words in answers
