Game notes:

- list 5 random categories from the dictionary
- player picks category
- pick random question from that category and ask player
- if the player is correct: reward $$$ points (eventally)
		for now, print "correct" and move on
- if the player is wrong: -200 points (eventually)
		for now, print "Wrong" and move on
- ask categories again

classes: 
	dictionary (module)
	player
	game
	category
	question / answer

	question/answer list
	category list

Write out a flowchart of how this game CURRENTLY works.

TODOS:
	X check for length of category and handle removing empty categories
	X make sure our category choices are UNIQUE!
	X let's make an ENGINE class/module to handle running games?
	X Build PARSER for handling skip words in answers 
	- Add handling parentheticals in answers
	- add something like "continue game" vs "start new game" ?
	- add "eternal game" function, so it adds new categories as we deplete them?
	- starting listing and adding scores

	X write a program that scans the jeopardy.csv and removes any questions with URLs in them (regex) (well sort of complete)
